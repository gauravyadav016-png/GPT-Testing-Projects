# LLM Answer Correction Checker

This repository contains a Streamlit application to compare answers generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) with the correct answers. The application uses Google's Gemini API to determine if the LLM's answers convey the same meaning as the correct answers.

## Features

- Upload an Excel or CSV file containing questions, correct answers, and LLM answers.
- Automatically compare the LLM answers with the correct answers using Google's Gemini API.
- Display the results in a DataFrame with a correction flag indicating whether the LLM answer matches the correct answer.
- Download the processed data as a CSV file.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/gauravyadav016-png/GPT-Testing-Projects.git
    cd GPT-Testing-Projects
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```


3. Set up the environment variable for the Google API key. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your API key:

    ```plaintext
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit application:

    ```sh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.

3. Upload your Excel or CSV file containing the following columns:
    - `questions`
    - `correct_answers`
    - `answers_by_llm`

4. Click the "Submit" button to process the file. The application will display the results in a table and provide an option to download the processed data as a CSV file.

## File Structure

- `app.py`: Main application code.
- `requirements.txt`: Required Python packages.
- `.env`: Environment variable for the Google API key (not included, needs to be created).
